## CLASS OVERVIEW
##
##      The main class
##        Yahoo::Search
##      begets
##        Yahoo::Search::Request
##      which begets
##        Yahoo::Search::Response
##      which begets a bunch of
##        Yahoo::Search::Result
##      which beget urls, summaries, etc.
##
## There are plenty of "convenience functions" which appear to bypass some
## of these steps as far as the user's view is concerned.

=head1 NAME

Yahoo::Search - Perl interface to the Yahoo! Search public API.

The following search spaces are supported:

=over 3

=item Doc

Common web search for documents (html, pdf, doc, ...), including Y!Q
contextual search.

=item Image

Image search (jpeg, png, gif, ...)

=item Video

Video file search (avi, mpeg, realmedia, ...)

=item News

News article search

=item Local

Yahoo! Local area (ZIP-code-based Yellow-Page like search)

=item Terms

A pseudo-search to report the important search terms from the provided
content or content+query.

=item Spell

A pseudo-search to fetch a "did you mean?" spelling suggestion for a search term.

=item Related

A pseudo-search to fetch "also try" related-searches for a search term.

=back

(Note: what this Perl API calls "Doc" Search is what Yahoo! calls "Web"
Search. But gee, aren't all web searches "Web" search, including
Image/News/Video/etc?)

Yahoo!'s raw API, which this package uses, is described at:

  http://developer.yahoo.net/

=head1 DOCS

The full documentation for this suite of classes is spread among these packages:

   Yahoo::Search
   Yahoo::Search::Request
   Yahoo::Search::Response
   Yahoo::Search::Result

However, you need C<use> only B<Yahoo::Search>, which brings in the others
as needed.

In the common case, you need read only the first and the last
(Yahoo::Search to create a query, and Yahoo::Search::Result to interpret
the results).

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Yahoo::Search provides a rich and full-featured set of classes for
accessing the various features of Yahoo! Search, and also offers a variety
of shortcuts to allow simple access, such as the following B<Doc> search:

 use Yahoo::Search;
 my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Doc => "Britney latest marriage",
                                      AppId => "YahooDemo",
                                      # The following args are optional.
                                      # (Values shown are package defaults).
                                      Mode         => 'all', # all words
                                      Start        => 0,
                                      Count        => 10,
                                      Type         => 'any', # all types
                                      AllowAdult   => 0, # no porn, please
                                      AllowSimilar => 0, # no dups, please
                                      Language     => undef,
                                     );
 warn $@ if $@; # report any errors

 for my $Result (@Results)
 {
     printf "Result: #%d\n",  $Result->I + 1,
     printf "Url:%s\n",       $Result->Url;
     printf "%s\n",           $Result->ClickUrl;
     printf "Summary: %s\n",  $Result->Summary;
     printf "Title: %s\n",    $Result->Title;
     printf "In Cache: %s\n", $Result->CacheUrl;
     print "\n";
 }

The first argument to C<Results> indicates which search space is to be
queried (in this case, B<Doc>). The second argument is the search term or
phrase (described in detail in the next section). Subsequent arguments are
optional key/value pairs (described in detail in the section after that) --
the ones shown in the example are those allowed for a B<Doc> query, with
the values shown being the defaults.

C<Results> returns a list of Yahoo::Search::Result objects, one per item
(in the case of a B<Doc> search, an item is a web page, I<pdf> document,
I<doc> document, etc.). The methods available to a C<Result> object are
dependent upon the search space of the original query -- see
Yahoo::Search::Result documentation for the complete list.

=head1 Search term / phrase

Within a search phrase ("C<Britney latest marriage>" in the example
above), words that you wish to be included even if they would otherwise be
eliminated as "too common" should be proceeded with a "C<+>". Words that you
wish to exclude should be proceeded with a "C<->". Words can be separated
with "C<OR>" (the default for the C<any> Mode, described below), and can be
wrapped in double quotes to identify an exact phrase (the default with the
C<phrase> Mode, also described below).

There are also a number of "Search Meta Words", as described at
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/basics/basics-04.html and
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/tips/tips-03.html , which can stand
along or be combined with B<Doc> searches (and, to some extent, some of the
others -- YMMV):

=over 4

=item B<site:>

allows one to find all documents within a particular domain and all its
subdomains. Example: B<site:yahoo.com>

=item B<hostname:>

allows one to find all documents from a particular host only.
Example: B<hostname:autos.yahoo.comm>

=item B<link:>

allows one to find documents that link to a particular url.
Example: B<link:http://autos.yahoo.com/>

=item B<url:>

allows one to find a specific document in Yahoo!'s index.
Example: B<url:http://edit.autos.yahoo.com/repair/tree/0.html>

=item B<inurl:>

allows one to find a specific keyword as part of indexed urls.
Example: B<inurl:bulgarian>

=item B<intitle:>

allows one to find a specific keyword as part of the indexed titles.
Example: B<intitle:Bulgarian>

=back

As an example combining a number of different search styles, consider

    my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Doc => 'site:TheSmokingGun.com "Michael Jackson" -arrest',
                                         AppId => "YahooDemo");

This returns data about pages at TheSmokingGun.com about Michael Jackson
that don't contain the word "arrest" (yes, there are actually a few such
pages).

=head1 Query arguments

As mentioned above, the arguments allowed in a C<Query> call depend upon
the search space of the query. Here is a table of the possible arguments,
showing which apply to queries of which search space:

Here are details of each:

=over 4

=item AppId

A 8-40 character string which identifies the application making use of the
Yahoo! Search API. (Think of it along the lines of an HTTP User-Agent
string.)

The characters allowed are space, plus C<A-Za-z0-9_()[]*+-=,.:@\>

This argument is required of all searches (sorry). You can make up whatever
AppId you'd like, but you are encouraged to register it via the link on

  http://developer.yahoo.net/

especially if you are creating something that will be widely distributed.

As mentioned below in I<Defaults and Default Overrides>, it's particularly
convenient to get the C<AppId> out of the way by putting it on the C<use>
line, e.g.

   use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'just testing';

It then applies to all queries unless explicitly overridden.

=item Mode

Must be one of: C<all> (the default), C<any>, or C<phrase>. Indicates how
multiple words in the search term are used: search for documents with
I<all> words, documents with I<any> words, or documents that contain the
search term as an exact I<phrase>.

=item Start

Indicates the ordinal of the first result to be returned, e.g. the "30" of
"showing results 30-40" (except that C<Start> is zero-based, not
one-based). The default is zero, meaning that the primary results will be
returned.

=item Count

Indicates how many items should be returned. The default is 10. The maximum
allowed depends on the search space being queried: B<20> for I<Local>
searches, and B<50> for others which support the C<Count> argument.

Note that

  Yahoo::Search::MaxCount($SearchSpace)

and

  $SearchEngine->MaxCount($SearchSpace)

return the maximum count allowed for the given C<$SearchSpace>.

=item Context

By providing a context string to a B<Doc> query, you change the request
from a normal document query to a Y!Q contextual query. Y!Q is described at

   http://yq.search.yahoo.com/

The C<Content> string can be raw text, html, etc., and is to provide the
document search more information about what kind of results are wanted.

For example, without a C<Context>, a document search for "Madonna" returns
the most popular documents (which are invariably about the famous pop
singer). However, if you provide a context string even as simple as "Virgin
Mary", the results skew away from the pop singer toward the Mother of God.
Since it's likely that a confusion between the two would be less than
optimal in pretty much every conceivable case, this is a Good Thing.

When a C<Context> is given, the query string itself may be empty. For
example, if you have the text of a blog entry in C<$BlogText>, you can
fetch "related links" via:

   use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'my blog stuff';
   my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Doc => undef, Context => $BlogText);

In a B<Terms> search, C<Context> is required.

=item Country

Attempts to restrict the B<Doc> search to web servers residing in the named
country. As of this writing, the Yahoo! web services support the following
codes for C<Country>:

 code   country
 ----   ---------------
  ar    Argentina
  au    Australia
  at    Austria
  be    Belgium
  br    Brazil
  ca    Canada
  cn    China
  cz    Czech Republic
  dk    Denmark
  fi    Finland
  fr    France
  de    Germany
  it    Italy
  jp    Japan
  kr    Korea
  nl    Netherlands
  no    Norway
  pl    Poland
  rf    Russian Federation
  es    Spain
  se    Sweden
  ch    Switzerland
  tw    Taiwan
  uk    United Kingdom
  us    United States

In addition, the code "default" is the same as the lack of a country
specifier: no country-related restrictions.


The above list can be found in C<%Yahoo::Search::KnownCountry>.

Because the list of countries may be updated more often than this Perl API,
this Perl API does not attempt to restrict the C<Country> value to members
of this specific list. If you provide a C<Country> value which is not
supported by Yahoo!'s web services, a "400 Bad Request" error is returned
in C<@$>.

=item License

For C<Doc> searches, can be:

=over 10

=item C<any>

(the default) -- results are not filtered with respect to licenses

=item C<cc_any>

Only items with a Creative Commons license (of any type) are returned.
See their (horribly designed hard to find anything substantial) site at:

  http://creativecommons.org/

=item C<cc_commercial>

Only items with a Creative Commons license which allows some kind of
commercial use are returned.

=item C<cc_modifiable>

Only items with a Creative Commons license which allows modification
(e.g. derived works) of some kind are returned.

=back

You may combine the above to create an intersection, e.g.

   License => "cc_commercial+cc_modifiable"

(space, comma, or plus-separated) returns items which allow I<both> some
kind of commercial use, and their use in some kinds of derivative works.

=item AllowSimilar

If this boolean is true (the default is false), similar results which would
otherwise not be returned are included in the result set.

=item AllowAdult

If this boolean is false (the default), results considered to be "adult"
(i.e. porn) are not included in the result set. Set to true to allow
unfiltered results.

Standard precautions apply about how the "is adult?" determination is not
perfect.

=item Type

This argument can be used to restrict the results to only a specific file
type. The default value, C<any>, allows any type associated with the search
space to be returned (that is, provides no restriction). Otherwise, the
values allowed for C<Type> depend on the search space:

 Search space    Allowed Type values
 ============    ========================================================
 Doc             any  html msword pdf ppt rss txt xls
 Image           any  bmp gif jpeg png
 Video           any  avi flash mpeg msmedia quicktime realmedia
 News            N/A
 Local           N/A
 Spell           N/A
 Related         N/A
 Term            N/A

(Deprecated: you may use C<all> in place of C<any>)

=item Language

If provided, attempts to restrict the results to documents in the given
language. The value is an language code such as C<en> (English), C<ja>
(Japanese), etc (mostly ISO 639-1 codes). As of this writing, the following
codes are supported:

 code  language
 ----  ---------
  sq   Albanian
  ar   Arabic
  bg   Bulgarian
  ca   Catalan
  szh  Chinese (simplified)
  tzh  Chinese (traditional)
  hr   Croatian
  cs   Czech
  da   Danish
  nl   Dutch
  en   English
  et   Estonian
  fi   Finnish
  fr   French
  de   German
  el   Greek
  he   Hebrew
  hu   Hungarian
  is   Icelandic
  it   Italian
  ja   Japanese
  ko   Korean
  lv   Latvian
  lt   Lithuanian
  no   Norwegian
  fa   Persian
  pl   Polish
  pt   Portuguese
  ro   Romanian
  ru   Russian
  sk   Slovak
  sl   Slovenian
  es   Spanish
  sv   Swedish
  th   Thai
  tr   Turkish

In addition, the code "default" is the same as the lack of a language
specifier, and seems to mean a mix of major world languages, skewed toward
English.

The above list can be found in C<%Yahoo::Search::KnownLanguage>.

Because the list of languages may be updated more often than this Perl API,
this Perl API does not attempt to restrict the C<Language> value to members
of this specific list. If you provide a C<Language> value which is not
supported by Yahoo!'s web services, a "400 Bad Request" error is returned
in C<@$>.

=item Sort

For B<News> searches, C<sort> may be C<rank> (the default) or C<date>.

For B<Local> searches, C<sort> may be C<relevance> (the default; most
relevant first), C<distance> (closest first), C<rating> (highest rating
first), or C<title> (alphabetic sort).

=item Color

For B<Image> searches, may be C<any> (the default), C<color>, or C<bw>:

=over 10

=item C<any>

No filtering based on colorization or lack thereof

=item C<color>

Only images with color are returned

=item C<bw>

Only black & white / grayscale images are returned

=back

=item Lat

=item Long

=item Street

=item City

=item State

=item PostalCode

=item Location

These items are for a B<Local> query, and specify the epicenter of the
search. The epicenter must be provided in one of a variety of ways:

=over 3

=item *

via C<Lat> and C<Long>

=item *

via the free-text C<Location>

=item *

via C<Street> and C<PostalCode>

=item *

via C<Street> and C<City> and C<State>

=item *

via C<PostalCode> alone

=item *

via C<City> and C<State> alone.

=back

The list above is the order of precedence for when multiple fields are sent
(e.g. if a C<Lat> and C<Long> are sent, they are used regardless of
whether, say, a C<PostalCode> is used), but it's probably best to send
exactly only the fields you wish to be used.

C<Lat> and C<Long> are floating point numbers, such as this example:

   Lat  =>  39.224079  # 39 deg 13 min 26.686 sec North
   Long => -98.541807, # 98 deg 32 min 30.506 sec West

(which happens to be the location of the "Medes Ranch" triangulation
station, upon which all country, state, etc., boundaries in North America
were originally based)

C<Street> is the street address, e.e. "701 First Ave". C<PostalCode> is a
US 5-digit or 9-digit ZIP code (e.g. "94089" or "94089-1234").

If C<Location> is provided, it supersedes the others. It should be a string
along the lines of "701 First Ave, Sunnyvale CA, 94089". The following forms
are recognized:

  city state
  city state zip
  zip
  street, city state
  street, city state zip
  street, zip

Searches that include a street address (either in the C<Location>, or if
C<Location> is empty, in C<Street>) provide for a more detailed epicenter
specification.

=item Radius

For B<Local> searches, indicates how wide an area around the epicenter to
search. The value is the radius of the search area, in miles. The default
radius depends on the search location (urban areas tend to have a smaller
default radius).

=item AutoContinue

A boolean (default off). If true, turns on the B<potentially dangerous>
auto-continuation, as described in the docs for C<NextResult> in
Yahoo::Search::Response.

=item Debug

C<Debug> is a string (defaults to an empty string). If the substring
"C<url>" is found anywhere in the string, the url of the Yahoo! request is
printed on stderr. If "C<xml>", the raw xml received is printed to stderr.
If "C<hash>", the raw Perl hash, as converted from the XML, is Data::Dump'd
to stderr.

Thus, to print all debugging, you'd set C<Debug> to a value such as "C<url
xml hash>".

=item PreRequestCallback

This is for debugging (I needed it for my own regression-test script). If
defined, it should be a code ref which accepts a single
Yahoo::Search::Request object argument. It is called just before Yahoo!'s
servers are contacted, and if it returns false, the call to Yahoo! is
aborted (be sure to set C<$@>).

=back

=head1 Class Hierarchy Details

The Y! Search API class system supports the following objects (all loaded
as needed via Yahoo::Search):

  Yahoo::Search
  Yahoo::Search::Request
  Yahoo::Search::Response
  Yahoo::Search::Result

Here is a summary of them:

=over 10

=item  Yahoo::Search

A "search engine" object which can hold user-specified default values for
search-query arguments. Often not used explicitly.

=item  Yahoo::Search::Request

An object which holds the information needed to make one search-query
request. Often not used explicitly.

=item  Yahoo::Search::Response

An object which holds the results of a query (including a bunch of
C<Result> objects).

=item  Yahoo::Search::Result

An object representing one query result (one image, web page, etc., as
appropriate to the original search space).

=back

=head1 "The Long Way", and Common Practice

The explicit way to perform a query and access the results is to first
create a "Search Engine" object:

  my $SearchEngine = Yahoo::Search->new();

Optionally, you can provide C<new> with key/value pairs as described in the
I<Query arguments> section above. Those values will then be available as
default values during subsequent request creation. (More on this later.)

You then use the search-engine object to create a request:

  my $Request = $SearchEngine->Request(Doc => Britney);

You then actually make the request, getting a response:

  my $Response = $Request->Fetch();

You can then access the set of C<Result> objects in a number of ways,
either all at once

  my @Results = $Response->Results();

or iteratively:


  while (my $Result = $Response->NextResult) {
               :
               :
  }

B<In Practice....>

In practice, one often does not need to go through all these steps
explicitly. The only reason to create a search-engine object, for example,
is to hold default overrides (to be made available to subsequent requests
made via the search-engine object). For example:

   use Yahoo::Search;
   my $SearchEngine = Yahoo::Search->new(AppId      => "Bobs Fish Mart",
                                         Count      => 25,
                                         AllowAdult => 1,
                                         PostalCode => 95014);

Now, calls to the various query functions (C<Query>, C<Results>) via this
C<$SearchEngine> will use these defaults (B<Image> searches, for example,
will be with C<AllowAdult> set to true, and B<Local> searches will be
centered at ZIP code 95014.) All will return up to 25 results.

In this example:

   my @Results = $SearchEngine->Results(Image => "Britney",
                                        Count => 20);

The query is made with C<AppId> as 'C<Bobs_Fish_Mart>' and C<AllowAdult>
true (both via C<$SearchEngine>), but C<Count> is 20 because explicit args
override the default in C<$SearchEngine>. The C<PostalCode> arg does not
apply too an B<Image> search, so the default provided from C<SearchEngine>
is not needed with this particular query.

B<Defaults on the 'use' line>

You can also provide the same defaults on the C<use> line. The following
example has the same result as the previous one:

   use Yahoo::Search AppId      => 'Bobs Fish Mart',
                     Count      => 25,
                     AllowAdult => 1,
                     PostalCode => 95014;

   my @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results(Image => "Britney",
                                        Count => 20);

=head1 Functions and Methods

Here, finally, are the functions and methods provided by Yahoo::Search.
In all cases, "...args..." are any of the key/value pairs listed in the
I<Query arguments> section of this document (e.g. "Count => 20")


=over 4

=item $SearchEngine = Yahoo::Search->new(...args...)

Creates a search-engine object (a container for defaults).
On error, sets C<$@> and returns nothing.



=item $Request = $SearchEngine->Request($space => $query, ...args...)

=item $Request = Yahoo::Search->Request($space => $query, ...args...)

Creates a C<Request> object representing a search of the named search space
(B<Doc>, B<Image>, etc.) of the given query string.

On error, sets C<$@> and returns nothing.

B<Note>: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the C<$space>/C<$query>
pair (which is required) is required to appear first.




=item $Response = $SearchEngine->Query($space => $query, ...args...)

=item $Response = Yahoo::Search->Query($space => $query, ...args...)

Creates an implicit C<Request> object, and fetches it, returning the
resulting C<Response>.

On error, sets C<$@> and returns nothing.

B<Note>: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the C<$space>/C<$query>
pair (which is required) is required to appear first.





=item @Results = $SearchEngine->Results($space => $query, ...args...)

=item @Results = Yahoo::Search->Results($space => $query, ...args...)

Creates an implicit C<Request> object, then C<Response> object,
in the end returning a list of C<Result> objects.

On error, sets C<$@> and returns nothing.

B<Note>: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the C<$space>/C<$query>
pair (which is required) is required to appear first.




=item @links = $SearchEngine->Links($space => $query, ...args...)

=item @links = Yahoo::Search->Links($space => $query, ...args...)

A super shortcut which goes directly from the query args to a list of

  <a href=...>...</a>

links. Essentially,

    map { $_->Link } Yahoo::Search->Results($space => $query, ...args...);

or, more explicitly:

    map { $_->Link } Yahoo::Search->new()->Request($space => $query, ...args...)->Fetch->Results(@_);

See C<Link> in the documentation for Yahoo::Search::Result.

B<Note>: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the C<$space>/C<$query>
pair (which is required) is required to appear first.





=item @links = $SearchEngine->Terms($space => $query, ...args...)

=item @links = Yahoo::Search->Terms($space => $query, ...args...)

A super shortcut for B<Spell>, B<Related>, and B<Terms> search spaces,
returns the list of spelling suggestions, related-search suggestions, or
important search terms, respectively.

B<Note>: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the C<$space>/C<$query>
pair (which is required) is required to appear first. For a B<Terms>
search, the C<$query> may be C<undef> (and in in any case, a B<Terms>
search requires a C<Context> argument).


For example,

   use Yahoo::Search AppId => "YahooDemo";
   for my $term (Yahoo::Search->Terms(Related => "Tivo")) {
       print $term , "\n";
   }

displays something along the lines of:

   directv tivo
   hd tivo
   tivo community
   tivo forum
   tivo upgrade
   tivo rebate
   dvd recorder tivo
   direct tv tivo
   tivo to go
   hdtv tivo


Here's an example with the B<Terms> search space:

   use Yahoo::Search AppId => "YahooDemo";

   my $Context = << '*END*';
   We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect
   Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the
   common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
   Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this
   Constitution for the United States of America.
   *END*

   for my $term (Yahoo::Search->Terms(Terms => undef, Context => $Context)) {
       print $term, "\n";
   }

displays something along the lines of:

  insure domestic tranquility
  promote the general welfare
  domestic tranquility
  united states
  states of america
  united states of america
  posterity
  blessings
  constitution
  perfect union

Note that a B<Spell> search returns at most one term.




=item @html = $SearchEngine->HtmlResults($space => $query, ...args...)

=item @html = Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults($space => $query, ...args...)

Like C<Links>, but returns a list of html strings (one representing each
result). See C<as_html> in the documentation for Yahoo::Search::Result.

A simple result display might look like

   print join "<p>", Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults(....);

or, perhaps

   if (my @HTML = Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults(....))
   {
      print "<ul>";
      for my $html (@HTML) {
         print "<li>", $html;
      }
      print "</ul>";
   }

As an example, here's a complete CGI which shows results from an
image-search, where the search term is in the 'C<s>' query string:

   #!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
   use CGI;
   my $cgi = new CGI;
   print $cgi->header();

   use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'my-search-app';
   if (my $term = $cgi->param('s')) {
       print join "<p>", Yahoo::Search->HtmlResults(Image => $term);
   }

The results, however, do look better with some style-sheet attention, such
as:

  <style>
    .yResult { display: block; border: #CCF 3px solid ; padding:10px }
    .yLink   { }
    .yTitle  { display:none }
    .yImg    { border: solid 1px }
    .yUrl    { display:none }
    .yMeta   { font-size: 80% }
    .ySrcUrl { }
    .ySum    { font-family: arial; font-size: 90% }
  </style>


B<Note>: all arguments are in key/value pairs, but the C<$space>/C<$query>
pair (which is required) is required to appear first.



=item $num = $SearchEngine->MaxCount($space)

=item $num = Yahoo::Search->MaxCount($space)

Returns the maximum allowed C<Count> query-argument for the given search space.



=item $SearchEngine->Default($key [ => $val ]);

If a new value is given, update the <$SearchEngine>'s value for the named
C<$key>.

In either case, the old value for C<$key> in effect is returned. If the
C<$SearchEngine> had a previous value, it is returned. Otherwise, the
global value in effect is returned.

As always, the key is from among those mentioned in the I<Query arguments>
section above.

The old value is returned.


=item Yahoo::Search->Default($key [ => $val ]);

Update or, if no new value is given, check the global default value for the
named argument. The key is from among those mentioned in the I<Query
examples> section above, as well as C<AutoCarp> (discussed below).

=back


=head1 Defaults and Default Overrides

All key/value pairs mentioned in the I<Query arguments> section may appear
on the C<use> line, in the call to the C<new> constructor, or in requests
that create a query explicitly or implicitly (C<Request>, C<Query>,
C<Results>, C<Links>, or C<HtmlResults>).

Each argument's value takes the first of the following which applies
(listed in order of precedence):

=over 6

=item 4)

The actual arguments to a function which creates (explicitly or implicitly)
a request.

=item 3)

Search-engine default overrides, set when the Yahoo::Search C<new>
constructor is used to create a search-engine object, or when that object's
C<Default> method is called.

=item 2)

Global default overrides, set on the C<use> line or via

 Yahoo::Search->Default()

=item 1)

Defaults hard-coded into these packages (e.g. C<Count> defaults to 10).

=back

It's particularly convenient to put the C<AppId> on the C<use> line,
e.g.

   use Yahoo::Search AppId => 'just testing';

=head1 AutoCarp

By default, detected errors that would be classified as programming errors
(e.g. use of incorrect args) are automatically spit out to stderr besides
being returned via C<$@>. This can be turned off via

  use Yahoo::Search AutoCarp => 0;

or

 Yahoo::Search->Default(AutoCarp => 0);

The default of true is somewhat obnoxious, but hopefully helps create
better programs by forcing the programmer to actively think about error
checking (if even long enough to turn off error reporting).


=head1 Global Variables

The following are globally available:

=over 5

=item C<%Yahoo::Search::KnownCountry>

A hash with the known (as of this writing) country codes supported by
Yahoo! for the C<Country> argument.

=item C<%Yahoo::Search::KnownLanguage>

A hash with the known (as of this writing) language codes supported by
Yahoo! for the C<Language> argument.

=item C<$Yahoo::Search::RecentRequestUrl>

The most recent REST url actually fetched from Yahoo! (perhaps useful for
debugging). It does I<not> reflect the fact that a request is changed to a
POST when request is sufficiently large. Thus, there are times when the url
on C<$Yahoo::Search::RecentRequestUrl> is not actually fetchable from the
Yahoo! servers.

=item C<$Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple>

If you set this to a true value, the XML returned by Yahoo! will be parsed
with B<XML::Simple> (if installed on your system) rather than with
Yahoo::Search::XML, a simple XML parser included as part of this package.
XML::Simple uses XML::Parser under the hood, and at least on the systems
I've tested it, XML::Parser suffers from a crippling memory leak that makes
it very undesirable.

However, if Yahoo! changes the XML they return in a way that my simple
parser can't handle, it tries parsing it with XML::Simple. If XML::Simple
is installed and can parse the XML, C<$Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple> is
automatically set to true and a warning generated suggesting that a bug
report be filed for Yahoo::Search::XML.

If you encounter a situation where Yahoo::Search::XML can't grok Yahoo!'s
XML, please submit a bug report. In the mean time, you can ensure that
XML::Simple is installed, set C<$Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple>, and at least
have things work until you run out of memory.

The default value of C<$Yahoo::Search::UseXmlSimple> is taken from the
environment variable C<YAHOO_SEARCH_XMLSIMPLE> if present, and otherwise
defaults to false.

=item C<$Yahoo::Search::Version>

A string in "X.Y.Z" format. The first number, the major version, increments
with large and/or backwards major incompatible changes. The second number
(minor version) updates with notable feature additions/changes. The third
number updates with every new release (and is the only one updated for
small bug- and typo fix releases).

=back

=head1 Environment

If C<YAHOO_SEARCH_XMLSIMPLE> is set to a true (nonempty, non-"0") value,
